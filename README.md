# LIFE Bank React Native Demo App

An example app for LIFE Bank utilizing Liferay's headless apis.

## Setup the Code

Please provide feedback for this. If you find anything is missing add an issue to this repo so I can update the steps. Or even better, send a pull request. ;)

This is a JavaScript applicaiton so you will need node and npm installed.

This Liferay React Native App is built using [Expo](https://expo.io/) which simplifies the creation of React Native apps.

` $ npm install expo-cli --global`

` $ npm install`

` $ npm start`

## Authentication

The App can be configured to use either OAuth2 or Basic Auth.

### OAuth2

To set OAuth2 up on Liferay you will need to create a new OAuth application through Liferay's administration. Configure it as shown in the image below.

You will then need to enable scopes to give the OAuth application access to Liferay. I've found this to be a little finnicky and thus simply enabled everything. To test any changes you make to scopes, you will need to log out and back in on the app.

At this point it should be working.
